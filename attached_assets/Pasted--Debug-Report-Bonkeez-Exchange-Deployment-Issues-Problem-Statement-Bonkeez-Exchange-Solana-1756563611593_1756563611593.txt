## Debug Report: Bonkeez Exchange Deployment Issues

### Problem Statement

Bonkeez Exchange (Solana NFT marketplace) deploys successfully but displays blank pages in production while functioning normally in local development.

### Progress Timeline

**Phase 1: Build System Fixes (Resolved)**

- Fixed Buffer import errors causing build failures
- Corrected Vite configuration for Node.js polyfills
- Resolved “Unexpected token” errors during compilation
- Result: Builds now complete successfully

**Phase 2: Runtime Debugging (Resolved)**

- Identified JavaScript execution working (console logs, API calls functioning)
- Confirmed React mounting and component initialization
- Eliminated server-side rendering issues
- Result: JavaScript layer functioning correctly

**Phase 3: CSS Processing Issues (Current)**

- Isolated problem to Tailwind CSS not processing in production builds
- Confirmed Tailwind dependencies installed (v3.4.17)
- Verified configuration files present (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js)
- Identified missing PostCSS integration in Vite configuration

### Current Status

- Latest build: Successful (44KB CSS generated, no build errors)
- Deployment: Complete but visual output still blank
- Root cause: Tailwind classes not being processed during production builds despite configuration files being present

### Remaining Issues

1. Vite configuration may still not be properly integrating PostCSS
1. Component-level errors in Header, Hero, TokenStats, or other imported components
1. CSS class conflicts or Tailwind purging too aggressively
1. Environment-specific differences between local and Vercel build processes

### Next Diagnostic Steps Required

1. Verify current deployed site behavior after latest configuration changes
1. Test individual component rendering to isolate failing components
1. Examine generated CSS output to confirm Tailwind processing
1. Consider alternative CSS approaches if Tailwind integration proves problematic

The pattern suggests a build-time CSS processing issue rather than runtime JavaScript errors, given that API functionality works but visual rendering fails consistently.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
